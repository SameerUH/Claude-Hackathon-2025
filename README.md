## (2ND PLACE) CLAUDE AI HACKATHON 2025 - LearnWell
Project my teammate (Arshia) and I made for the Claude A.I. hackathon hosted at Northumbria university.

### Theme:
How might we use AI to transform university learning into personalised, accessible experiences that help students both master their subject AND recognise the transferable skills they're developing for future careers?

### Project:
A tool which take in user behaviour and qualities (Preferred learning style, mental barriers, average hours of sleep, other committments, etc.) and their module content, then using Anthropic's API generates a study plan to catch up to the content and project ideas for students to do outside of university which enhances their portfolio and helps them stand out.
